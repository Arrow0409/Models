1. Developed a spam detection system using Python, Scikit-learn, and Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) to analyze and classify SMS messages by implementing text      preprocessing techniques such as stop word removal, stemming, and punctuation removal to enhance model accuracy. Evaluated and compared multiple classification        models, including Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machines, to identify the most effective model for spam detection.
